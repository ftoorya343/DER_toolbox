Net Electric Costs per Unit shall be the total energy costs for the previous month less the total demand billing for the previous month divided by the number of kWh sold (determined as kWh purchased less a historical line loss of 3.03%).

Electric Demand: Demand is defined as the maximum average load during any fifteen(15) consecutive minutes during the month, adjusted for power factor as follows: When a customer's average monthly power factor is less than 85% lagging, the maximum 15-minute demand measured during the month will be adjusted by multiplying the measured demand by 85% and dividing by the average monthly power factor in percent. Average monthly power factor is the monthly kWh usage divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the kWh usage and the lagging reactive KVAH supplied during the month.",http://www.vpuc.com/Procedures%20-%20Rates%20-%20Policies/Rate%20brochure.pdf,,,,,,

Energy Acquisition Adjustment: The applicable electric rate shall be adjusted monthly by the amount the Net Electric Costs per Unit exceeds the base energy cost per unit of $.02553. Net Electric Costs per Unit shall be the total energy costs for the previous month less the total demand billing for the previous month divided by the number of kWh sold (determined as kWh purchased less a historical line loss of 3.03%).

Electric Demand: Demand is defined as the maximum average load during any fifteen(15) consecutive minutes during the month, adjusted for power factor as follows: When a customer's average monthly power factor is less than 85% lagging, the maximum 15-minute demand measured during the month will be adjusted by multiplying the measured demand by 85% and dividing by the average monthly power factor in percent. Average monthly power factor is the monthly kWh usage divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the kWh usage and the lagging reactive KVAH supplied during the month.

This schedule is not available for service when another commercial/industrial schedule is applicable.


Billing Demand: The billing demand in any billing cycle will be the maximum average power taken during any metering interval in the period, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. (The customary metering interval is 15 minutes; in cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a 5-minute interval may be used.)

Assignment to Schedule: If, in the judgement of the City, an account is expected to have usage over 8,000 kWh per billing cycle, the City has the option of placing the account immediately on this schedule.

When an account billed on this schedule permanently changes the nature of electrical operations to such an extent that the account would in time qualify for another rate schedule, such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify the City of any such changes.

If energy consumption drops below 8,000 kWh and remains there for 12 consecutive billing cycles, the City will transfer the account to the appropriate schedule. If the billing demand reaches or exceeds 400 kW for three consecutive billing cycles, the account will be transferred to the appropriate rate schedule as soon as practicable.

*G1-Non-profit (as defined in Federal Internal Revenue 501 (c) (3)) Industrial/Commercial customers who are currently receiving Federal Community Development Block Grant funds or have received such funds not more than two years before preparation of the current billing cycle charge are eligible for the following discount on Energy and Demand charges: 

July 1, 1996 and after: 30%

It is the customer's responsibility to notify the Finance Department of this eligibility.

This discount may not be used in conjunction with any other incentive discount.

*Plus or Minus the BPCA

Demand: The billing period and peak period demands will be the maximum average power taken during any 15-minute period interval in the billing period and peak period, respectively, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. In cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a 5-minute interval may be used.

Assignment to Schedule: Assignment to this schedule is at the option of the customer and does not supersede any standby service contracts.

This rate schedule is prospective and not subject to rebate or retroactivity.

When a customer chooses to be assigned to this schedule, the customer elects the City of Lodi (City) to be the sole electric power requirements provider of choice. The customer must give the City three year written notice before the customer can elect to use another electric power requirements provider.

When a customer has a measurable incremental permanent load increase of 200 kW or greater, over the highest billing period demand in the previous twelve (12) months the customer will be eligible for a ten (10) percent discount on the incremental Demand and Energy charges. Such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes and is not subject to rebate or retroactivity.

This schedule is not available for service when another commercial/industrial schedule is applicable.


Billing Demand: The billing demand in any billing cycle will be the maximum average power taken during any metering interval in the period, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. (The customary metering interval is 15 minutes; in cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a 5-minute interval may be used.)

Assignment to Schedule: If, in the judgement of the City, an account is expected to have usage over 8,000 kWh per billing cycle, the City has the option of placing the account immediately on this schedule.

When an account billed on this schedule permanently changes the nature of electrical operations to such an extent that the account would in time qualify for another rate schedule, such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify the City of any such changes.

If energy consumption drops below 8,000 kWh and remains there for 12 consecutive billing cycles, the City will transfer the account to the appropriate schedule. If the billing demand reaches or exceeds 400 kW for three consecutive billing cycles, the account will be transferred to the appropriate rate schedule as soon as practicable. 

*G1-Non-profit (as defined in Federal Internal Revenue 501 (c) (3)) Industrial/Commercial customers who are currently receiving Federal Community Development Block Grant funds or have received such funds not more than two years before preparation of the current billing cycle charge are eligible for the following discount on Energy and Demand charges:

July 1, 1996 and after: 30%

It is the customer's responsibility to notify the Finance Department of this eligibility.

Assignment to Schedule: If, in the judgement of the City, an account is expected to have usage below 8,000 kWh per billing cycle, the City has the option of placing the account immediately on this schedule.

When an account billed on this schedule permanently changes the nature of electrical operations to such an extent that the account would in time qualify for another rate schedule, such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes.

If energy consumption equals or exceeds 8,000 kWh for three consecutive billing cycles, the City will transfer the account to the appropriate rate schedule. If the demand reaches or exceeds 400 kW for three consecutive billing cycles, the account will be transferred to the appropriate rate schedule.

Definitions.

Bulk power cost (BPC) means those costs during the calculation period related to the purchase of wholesale power and the ownership of generation. 

Bulk power cost true-up (BPCT) means the difference between the bulk power cost actually incurred and the bulk power cost recovered through the power cost base and the bulk power cost adjustment may be deposited in or removed from a true-up account, as applicable. The BPCT is that portion of the true-up account to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

Rate stabilization fund adjustment (RSFA) means funds to offset sudden and/or temporary changes in the cost of power may be deposited in or removed from a rate stabilization fund, as applicable. The RSFA is that portion of the rate stabilization fund to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

System loss factor means the factor applied to adjust the bulk power unit cost from a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of purchases to a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of sales. 

Power cost base means the bulk power-related cost that is embedded within the base retail rate, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy charge includes a power cost base of $0.060150 per kwh in the base rate. 

Bulk power cost adjustment (BPCA) means the difference between the adjusted bulk power unit cost and the power cost base, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour, as determined by the calculation.

At any point on the City's interconnected system where there are facilities of adequate capacity. 

This schedule is for electric service applications for customers that have alternate renewable electric power generation on the customer side of the meter. This schedule is intended for customers that generate electric energy from renewable sources that they would otherwise purchase from the City utility.

A customers generating facility used for net metering shall be equipped with metering equipment that can measure the flow of electricity in both directions. The city will install a meter capable of measuring bi-directional energy flow at the customer's expense. The normal cost of a meter will be deducted from the cost of the bi-directional meter. 

This will normally be accomplished through use of a single bidirectional meter. At the customer's request and expense an additional meter may be installed for the customer's purposes. Other requirements are outlined in the Logan City Light and Power Net Metering Policy.

The customer shall adhere to all service and billing requirements including the installation of approved metering equipment as per Logan City Electric Service Requirements.


Energy Rate for Energy Purchased by the Customer: 

The City shall credit the Customer in kilowatt-hours (kWH) at a ratio of 1:1 for any excess production of their generating facility that exceeds the customer's on-site consumption of kWh in the billing period each month. Excess energy generated by the customer which would otherwise be purchased from the utility will offset energy at the full retail rates up to the amount of energy the customer uses each month.  Excess energy generated beyond the customers use during daytime hours will be purchased by the utility at the rate specified below. Energy generated during the night time, through battery backup systems, will not be purchased under this schedule.

Residential customers will be charged the current Rate Schedule 1. Commercial customers will be charged under the applicable current Commercial Rate Schedule which they qualify for based on criteria in the electric rate schedules. All of the rate schedules may be changed from time to time.",http://www.loganutah.org/Light%20and%20Power/Rates/alternative.cfm?CFTREEITEMKEY=AENM,,,,,,

This schedule is not available for service when another commercial/industrial schedule is applicable.


Demand: The billing period and peak period demands will be the maximum average power taken during any 15-minute interval in the billing period and peak period, respectively, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. In cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a 5-minute interval may be used.

Assignment to Schedule: If, in the judgement of the City, an account is expected to have billing period demand of 400 kW or more and less than 500 kW per billing cycle, the City has the option of placing the account immediately on this schedule.

When an account billed on this schedule permanently changes the nature of electrical operations to such an extent that the account would in time qualify for another rate schedule, such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify the City of any such changes.

If billing period demand drops below 400 kW and remains there for 12 consecutive billing cycles, the City will transfer the account to the appropriate rate schedule. If billing period demand reaches or exceeds 500 kW for three consecutive billing cycles, the account will be transferred to the appropriate rate schedule.

Definitions.

Bulk power cost (BPC) means those costs during the calculation period related to the purchase of wholesale power and the ownership of generation. 

Bulk power cost true-up (BPCT) means the difference between the bulk power cost actually incurred and the bulk power cost recovered through the power cost base and the bulk power cost adjustment may be deposited in or removed from a true-up account, as applicable. The BPCT is that portion of the true-up account to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

Rate stabilization fund adjustment (RSFA) means funds to offset sudden and/or temporary changes in the cost of power may be deposited in or removed from a rate stabilization fund, as applicable. The RSFA is that portion of the rate stabilization fund to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

 System loss factor means the factor applied to adjust the bulk power unit cost from a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of purchases to a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of sales. 

 Power cost base means the bulk power-related cost that is embedded within the base retail rate, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy charge includes a power cost base of $0.060150 per kwh in the base rate. 

 Bulk power cost adjustment (BPCA) means the difference between the adjusted bulk power unit cost and the power cost base, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour, as determined by the calculation. This is also referred to as the purchased power/fuel adjustment factor.",http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=10857,,,,,,

          (1)     Service Charge (per month): $ 3.12

          (2)     kW Charge.  The kW Charge shall be calculated by determining the total demand charges from all power and transmission invoices received by the village, and adding a cost recovery of $1,504. If the village is purchasing power at 69,000 volts and utilizing village equipment to transform to 12,500 volts, than the cost recovery figure of $1,504 shall be $5,504. The total demand charges shall include any wheeling, power supply, transmission, ancillary services, customer, scheduling charges, service fees, and applicable taxes, but shall not include kilovar charges.

     The resulting base kW shall be increased by 4% and applied to the customer's bill as the kW charge.

          (3)     kWh Charge.  The kWh charge shall be calculated by adding all kWh charges from all power and transmission invoices received by the village. Previous month credit or debit will be calculated using the total dollar amount, and adding $376. This total divided by the total number of kWh purchased, plus $0.015/kWh, will be the base kWh.

     The resulting base kWh shall be increased by 4% and applied to the customer's bill as the kWh charge.

          (4)     Power Cost Adder.  Customers under this rate schedule shall be charged an additional rate of 10% of the sum of all kW, kWh, and Customer Charges.

     (C)     Minimum Charge.  The minimum charge shall be $5.00 per month.

Energy Acquisition Adjustment: The applicable electric rate shall be adjusted monthly by the amount the Net Electric Costs per Unit exceeds the base energy cost per unit of $.02553. Net Electric Costs per Unit shall be the total energy costs for the previous month less the total demand billing for the previous month divided by the number of kWh sold (determined as kWh purchased less a historical line loss of 3.03%).

Electric Demand: Demand is defined as the maximum average load during any fifteen(15) consecutive minutes during the month, adjusted for power factor as follows: When a customer's average monthly power factor is less than 85% lagging, the maximum 15-minute demand measured during the month will be adjusted by multiplying the measured demand by 85% and dividing by the average monthly power factor in percent. Average monthly power factor is the monthly kWh usage divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the kWh usage and the lagging reactive KVAH supplied during the month.
